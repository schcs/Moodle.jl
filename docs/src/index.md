# Moodle.jl
*An experimental Julia package for creating Moodle questions.*

A simple change.

## Package Features
Currently the package can be used to create the following types of questions:
- short answer type questions;
- matching question;
- multiple choice questions.

## Installing the package
Will write here how to install the package once it's written as a module.

## Short answer type question
In the case of short answer type questions, Moodle displays a question and provides the students with a text box where they can put in their answers. The answer is compared to the stored correct answer and points will be given if they agree.
